# Danger-Run-Game
Player has to avoid the obstacles to survive by either jumping or sliding. With time the speed of player and map will increase to make the game little challenging.
mainV2.0 is the python code for the game.
I have also included the sprite used in the game in the images folder.
There is no sound in the game but if you like you can include the music and sound in the game with the help of mixer() in pygame.
